# -Calculation-of-M-polynomial-topological-indices-and-entropy-of-indices
Please follow the algorithm below to apply the two-step computer-based computational technique on graph G: Step 1: Drawing graph G using the drawing tool on the ChemSpider website and calculate its edge matrix B. Step 2: Using a MATLAB program, input the matrix B to calculate topological and entropy of indices.
